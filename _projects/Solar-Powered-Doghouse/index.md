title: Solar=Powered Doghouse
description: 
For my first engineering project, I designed and built a fully functional Smart Doghouse over the course of five months, funded by Cooper Carry through my school’s Innovation Academy. The project followed a structured five-phase design thinking process, moving systematically through research, prototyping, 3D printing, woodworking, testing, and final completion.

The Smart Doghouse integrated several innovative features focused on comfort, accessibility, and sustainability:

Rainwater Collection System: A system mounted on the back of the doghouse collected rainwater, filtered it, and dispensed it into a bowl, providing the dog with clean drinking water.

Pneumatic Storage Accessibility: We incorporated pneumatic mechanisms that allowed the storage portion of the doghouse to open remotely from the inside. This feature enabled the dog to access toys independently and enhanced overall accessibility for humans.

Thermal and Ventilation Design: To reduce heat buildup, we chose neutral gray tones and implemented higher ceilings with high “windows” for optimal airflow and natural ventilation.

Solar Power Integration: The doghouse was designed to include solar panels to supply energy for the pneumatic system and other electronic components, making the design self-sustainable.

This project was an introduction to combining mechanical design, sustainability, and user-centered engineering, giving me practical experience in prototyping, testing, and applying engineering principles in a real-world application.
